/*
  Route Handlers - GET
  - Route Handlers allow you to create custom request handlers for a given route using the Web Request and Response APIs.
  - The following HTTP methods are supported: GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE, HEAD, and OPTIONS. If an unsupported method is called, Next.js will return a 405 Method Not Allowed response.
  - In addition to supporting native Request and Response. Next.js extends them with NextRequest and NextResponse to provide convenient helpers for advanced use cases.
