/*
  Loading Component
  - The "special file loading.js" helps you create meaningful Loading UI with React Suspense. 
    -> With this convention, you can show an instant loading state from the server while the content of a route segment loads. 
    -> The new content is automatically swapped in once rendering is complete.
