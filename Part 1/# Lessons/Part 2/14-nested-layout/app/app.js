/*
  Nested Layouts
  - we will create a layout (UI) that is added to /drinks segment
    -> share layout to routes under /drinks
    -> this layout is a DaisyUI component

  - https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/layout


****************************

  - don't forget about the "children"
  - we can fetch data in the layout but...
    -> at the moment CAN'T pass data down to children (pages) 😞


****************************

  1. create app/drinks/layout.js
