/*
  Client Form Component
  - since we need to use useState to manage the state -> must be "client component"
  - this component will be sent to browser

  1. create app/tickets/create/page.jsx
  2. create app/tickets/create/CreateForm.jsx -> no need to place in components/ for simplicity


\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

  Build the App
  ~~ npm run build
  ~~ npm start
    -> run with the built app
