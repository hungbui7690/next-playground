/*
  Protecting Routes
  - There will be pages that we don't want to be accessed unless the user is logged in. For example, the add property page should only be accessible to logged in users. We can protect routes by using a middleware function.


***************************

  1. root/middleware.js
  2. Navbar.jsx
    -> only show "Add Property" link when login
